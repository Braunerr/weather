                    In order for a weather phenomenon to be registered as an extreme weather phenomenon, at least one of the following criteria must be met: 
                    <br>
                    10 or more people dead.
                    <br>
                    100 or more people affected.
                    <br>
                    The declaration of a state of emergency.
                    <br>
                    A call for international assistance.

                    When you look at the line diagram that shows the different extreme weather phenomena, you will be able to see that there are places where the lines are completely horizontal. This is either because the number of weather phenomena has been the same in the years in question or it is because no extreme weather phenomena have been recorded for some reason. We have chosen that in cases where no extreme weather phenomena have been recorded to insert the average value before and after the missing data.
